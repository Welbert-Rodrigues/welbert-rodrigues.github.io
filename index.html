    <p>A 30% deposit is required to secure your appointment. This amount will be deducted from the total cost of your tattoo. The deposit is non-refundable. If you cancel on the day of your session, a 10% rescheduling fee will be charged based on the total tattoo cost.</p>
    
    <h2>Waitlist</h2>
    <p>When I open my schedule for other states or countries, I begin the booking process for those locations. Once dates are confirmed, I notify clients on the waitlist in advance, giving them priority in choosing their appointment time.</p>
    <p>To confirm your appointment, a 50% deposit is required. Due to limited availability, cancellations without notice will incur a 20% rescheduling fee, depending on availability.</p>
